This folder contains javascript and html for creating a table that lists assume-guarentee contracts and their values in an aggregate run

## How to:
1: Click on the index.html in your PC file folder (You may need a server if you are using main.js in the .html, I use Live Server for VS Code)

2: Open the main directory in your favorite code editor

3: Edit and take whatever parts of the code is most suited for your project :)

## Files
index.html: table template. Currently contains buttons for uploading files, but they can be removed if your files are coming from the back-end

main.js: Contains all of the javascript code to make the table function. 

mvc.js: "Model, View, Controller" - entry-point for sectioned javascript files. If you use this file, you need to run your html on a server. I use Live Server from VS Code

js> This folder contains the sectioned out javascript. See file names for what each file does
