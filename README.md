This is the main directory for MOUS3: (Manageably Observing and Understand by Seeing SpecificationS)

More information will be added as the project progresses

## How to:
1: Click on the index.html in your PC file folder (You may need a server if you are using main.js in the .html, I use Live Server for VS Code)

2: Open the main directory in your favorite code editor

3: Edit and take whatever parts of the code is most suited for your project :)
