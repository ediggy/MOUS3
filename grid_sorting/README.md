This folder contains javascript and html for creating a table that lists assume-guarentee contracts and their values in an aggregate run

## How to:
1: Click on the index.html in your PC file folder (You may need a server if you are using main.js in the .html, I use Live Server for VS Code)

2: Open the main directory in your favorite code editor

3: Edit and take whatever parts of the code is most suited for your project :)

## Files
index.html: contains div with buttons to connect to javascript

main.js: Contains all of the javascript code and sorting logic to sort your table from contract_data_grid
